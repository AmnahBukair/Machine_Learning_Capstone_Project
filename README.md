# Machine_Learning_Capstone_Project
This project was submitted to fulfill the requirments of Corsera course : Machine Learning with Python  
## Project Description   
In this project, i had complete a notebook where i built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.  

First, a historical dataset from previous loan applications was loaded and the data was cleaned.  
Next,i applied different classification algorithm on the data. 
These algorithms are:  
* k-Nearest Neighbour  
* Decision Tree  
* Support Vector Machine  
* Logistic Regression  

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoass (only works with Logistic Regression as it requires probability of each event occurance)
## Project Parts
This project is divided into three parts:
* PART 1: Load and Process the Data.
* PART 2: Classification.
* PART 3: Model Evaluation using Test set.


#### Notes
1. Some phrases in the code were written by course providers to show where to start.   
For example: 'Now it is your turn' or 'you have to do ...'.   
please ignore these phrases (;  
  
2. I had an error with calculating accuracy index. They value copy itself each time i call the function.  
I will appreciate if you suggest me some corrective steps!
